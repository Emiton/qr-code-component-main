## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to experiment with the basics of flexbox. Using minimal knowledge of flexbox, I was able to properly align the items within the flex container.



```css
.card {
  margin: auto;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  width: 300px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to use flexbox in a more complex project. Additionally, I need to spend some time looking into CSS properties and their common use cases. I have an understanding of the fundamentals, but my intuition still needs to be developed.
